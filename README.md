## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher.
2. **Operating System**: Windows (recommended for full functionality).
3. **Libraries and Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Microphone**: For voice input.
5. **Speaker or Headphones**: For audio output.
6. **Google Chrome**: Required for certain features like Google Search.
7. **API Keys**: Add your own API credentials for services like:
   - Weather (OpenWeatherMap API)
   - Google OAuth (for Calendar and other integrations)
   - News API (for fetching news headlines)
8. **Notepad++ (Optional)**: For enhanced note-taking functionality.

## DeepSeek Model Configuration

The application uses the `deepseek-r1:1.5b` parameter model by default, as it is optimized for basic-level laptops. If you have a more powerful computer or laptop, you can change the model to a higher parameter version for better performance and accuracy. Update the model configuration in the `deepseek_integration.py` file as per your requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NIGASH333/J.A.R.V.I.S.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd JARVIS-master
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the voice prompts to interact with JARVIS.

## Configuration

- Update the `Jarvis/config.py` file with your API keys and other configuration settings as needed.
- Add your own API credentials for services like weather, Google OAuth, and others to ensure proper functionality.
